    "text": "Summary plots\nWe first explore the NDVI variable that tells us how well crops are doing and compare the health of crops over time, and across different variables.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the temperature in Illinois fluctuates seasonally in the same way between the years 2000 and 2023.\nWe now plot the NDVI and EVI variables over time, we can see a cyclic pattern, which have one peak and valley each year, this makes sense because the seasons likely strongly affect NDVI and EVI, so we expect to see this cyclic pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, vegetation indices in Illinois also fluctuate seasonally in the same way between the years 2000 and 2023.\nWe next plot NDVI as a function of temperature, where it looks like we see linear correlation. This also is to be expected because crops tend to do better in the summer when the temperature is warmer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 indicates a positive correlation between NDVI and maximum temperature.\nNext we plot NDVI as a function of precipitation. This plot is harder to see direct correlation between NDVI and precipitation but it gives us a sense of what the data look like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we plot the relationship between NDVI and EVI which seems to be correlated, which would be expected because they are different measurements for plant health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no clear correlation between NDVI and precipitation levels (Figure 4).\nNow now make pairwise scatter plots of climate and vegetation variables of interest. These scatter plots look like they show linear correlations between the vegetation variables (NDVI and EVI) and temperature. The relationship between precipitation and the vegetation variables is less clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs depicted by Figure 6, there is a clear correlation between temperature, EVI, and NDVI, while the relationship between these variables and precipitation is unclear."

This could pose a problem when developing a prediction model.\nThe list above shows that if we were to have a 0.85 cutoff for correlation, over half of the variables would be excluded from our prediction model.\n\n\nK-Means Clustering\nFinally we use K-Means clustering to look at feature importance. We use K-means clustering to select important features that will be used in the final model phase of the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final selected climate features to be used in the next step of analysis are swe, prcp, tmax, tmin, vp and dayl."

Understanding climate-driven changes in cropland productivity is essential for all community stakeholders, including policymakers and farmers, to make informed decisions and adapt effectively. To achieve these objectives, our project aims to integrate three key datasets: one for mapping US croplands, one serving as a proxy for vegetation health through metrics such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and one for climate data, including temperature and precipitation."

    "text": "Types of Vegetation Metrics\n\nEvapotranspiration (ET): Measures the total water loss from soil and plants; higher ET indicates active plant growth and sufficient water availability. Over 25 years, an overall decrease in ET due to climate change could indicate reduced plant activity or increased water stress.\nFraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR): Represents the fraction of sunlight absorbed by vegetation for photosynthesis; higher FPAR denotes healthier, more productive crops. Over 25 years, a declining FPAR trend could indicate an overall reduction in crop canopy density.\nLeaf Area Index (LAI): Quantifies the total leaf area per unit ground area; higher LAI reflects denser foliage and robust plant growth. Over 25 years, an overall decrease in LAI over time could point to diminished vegetation cover or stunted growth.\nEnhanced Vegetation Index (EVI): An index that enhances vegetation signals by reducing atmospheric and soil background noise; higher EVI values correspond to healthier vegetation. Over 25 years, a downward trend in EVI might indicate declining vegetation vigor.\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): Assesses vegetation greenness by comparing red and near-infrared reflectance; higher NDVI values signify healthier, greener vegetation. Over 25 years, a decrease in NDVI over 25 years could suggest reduced vegetation health or coverage.\nNDVI and EVI capture vegetation greenness and vigor, offering a direct assessment of plant health, whereas LAI, FPAR, and ET provide information on structural and functional aspects of vegetation. The scientific basis for preferring NDVI/EVI lies in their sensitivity to chlorophyll content and ability to detect changes in vegetation health more directly. The general hypothesis is: if the climate in 2000 was more favorable for crops than in 2024, we would expect to see higher values of ET, FPAR, LAI, EVI, and NDVI in 2000, reflecting more vigorous plant growth, denser foliage, and healthier vegetation due to optimal growing conditions."

    "text": "We decide to run a time series multiple linear regression model to predict the different plant health variables (for example the NDVI variable) of cropland in Illinois over time using the climate variables. To do this we use the library fable that allows us to run the model from a tsibble (a tibble with a time series component). We train the model on the data from 2000 to 2020 and then use the model to predict the health variable for the years 2021 to 2024. We then create the following plot to compare the actual data to the predicted confidence intervals.\nWe first split the data into training and test data. We train the model on the data from 2000 to 2020 and then test the model on data from 2020 to 2024. We then build the model for each plant health variable. Finally we forcast the performance of the model using the test data on each of the plant health variables. The plots below show the resulting predictions from our models for each of the plant health variables of interest.\nThe following plots have the true value of the variable of interest over time displayed as the black line and the confidence interval of the model-predicted data onto the range of test data (from 2020 to 2024) displayed as a blue shaded region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot A shows the measured value of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over time.
